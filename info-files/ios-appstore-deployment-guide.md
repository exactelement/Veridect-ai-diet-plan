```

### Create Launch Screen

Design `LaunchScreen.storyboard`:

```swift
// Simple launch screen with app logo
// Avoid loading indicators or text
// Use similar colors to main interface
// Keep it minimal and fast-loading

import UIKit

class LaunchScreenViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Add app logo centered
        let logoImageView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "launch_logo"))
        logoImageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
        logoImageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        
        view.addSubview(logoImageView)
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            logoImageView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
            logoImageView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor),
            logoImageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 120),
            logoImageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 120)
        ])
    }
}
```
