    compileSdk 34

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.yesnoapp.android"
        minSdk 24
        targetSdk 34
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"

        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
        debug {
            applicationIdSuffix ".debug"
            debuggable true
        }
    }

    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('../keystore/yesnoapp-release.keystore')
            storePassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
            keyAlias "yesnoapp"
            keyPassword System.getenv("KEY_PASSWORD")
        }
    }

    bundle {
        language {
            enableSplit = false
        }
        density {
            enableSplit = true
        }
        abi {
            enableSplit = true
        }
    }
}
```

### Create Release Keystore

```bash
# Generate release keystore
keytool -genkey -v \
    -keystore yesnoapp-release.keystore \
    -alias yesnoapp \
    -keyalg RSA \
    -keysize 2048 \
    -validity 25000

# Store keystore info securely
echo "Keystore password: [your_keystore_password]"
echo "Key alias: yesnoapp"
echo "Key password: [your_key_password]"

# Set environment variables
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="your_keystore_password"
export KEY_PASSWORD="your_key_password"
```

### Configure ProGuard

Create `app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```proguard
# Keep Google Fit API classes
-keep class com.google.android.gms.fitness.** { *; }
-keep class com.google.android.gms.auth.** { *; }

# Keep Retrofit/OkHttp classes
-keep class retrofit2.** { *; }
-keep class okhttp3.** { *; }

# Keep data models
-keep class com.yesnoapp.android.data.** { *; }

# Keep enum classes
-keepclassmembers enum * {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}

# Keep Serializable classes
-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private static final java.io.ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}

# Remove logging in release
-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log {
    public static *** d(...);
    public static *** v(...);
    public static *** i(...);
}
```

## Step 3: App Metadata and Assets
