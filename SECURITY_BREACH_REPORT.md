# CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT

**Date:** June 25, 2025, 4:00 PM CET
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXING IN PROGRESS

## Incident Summary

A critical data breach vulnerability was discovered in the data export functionality where user `test12@10xr.es` was able to export personal data belonging to `hardmusicparty@gmail.com`.

## Root Cause

**Vulnerable Code Pattern:**
```javascript
const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id;
```

This fallback logic in authentication can pick up incorrect user sessions, leading to cross-user data access.

## Affected Endpoints

22 endpoints identified with the same vulnerable pattern:
- `/api/auth/export-data` (CRITICAL - confirmed breach)
- `/api/auth/user`
- `/api/user/profile`
- `/api/food/analyze`
- All user-specific data endpoints

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. âœ… Identified vulnerability in data export endpoint
2. âœ… Fixed data export endpoint (no fallback to req.user?.id)
3. ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Fixing all remaining 21 endpoints
4. âœ… Created audit trail in database
5. âœ… Documented incident for compliance

## Technical Fix

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```javascript
const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id;
```

**After (Secure):**
```javascript
const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub;
if (!userId) {
  return res.status(401).json({ message: "User not properly authenticated" });
}
```

## Data Breach Scope

- **Affected Users:** test12@10xr.es (unauthorized access), hardmusicparty@gmail.com (data exposed)
- **Data Exposed:** User profile, food logs, weekly scores, subscription status
- **Access Method:** GDPR data export endpoint vulnerability

## Compliance Impact

- GDPR Article 33: Breach notification required within 72 hours
- User notification required due to high risk to individual rights
- Internal incident logging completed

## Next Steps

1. Complete fixing all vulnerable endpoints
2. Notify affected users (hardmusicparty@gmail.com)
3. Review session management for potential mixing issues
4. Implement additional security auditing
5. Consider legal/compliance review

## Prevention

- Remove ALL fallback authentication patterns
- Implement strict user ID validation
- Add security audit logging for data access
- Regular security reviews of authentication code
