# CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT

**Date:** June 25, 2025, 4:00 PM CET
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXING IN PROGRESS

## Incident Summary

A critical data breach vulnerability was discovered in the data export functionality where user `test12@10xr.es` was able to export personal data belonging to `hardmusicparty@gmail.com`.

## Root Cause

**Vulnerable Code Pattern:**
```javascript
const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id;
```

This fallback logic in authentication can pick up incorrect user sessions, leading to cross-user data access.

## Affected Endpoints

22 endpoints identified with the same vulnerable pattern:
- `/api/auth/export-data` (CRITICAL - confirmed breach)
- `/api/auth/user`
- `/api/user/profile`
- `/api/food/analyze`
- All user-specific data endpoints

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. âœ… Identified vulnerability in data export endpoint
2. âœ… Fixed data export endpoint (no fallback to req.user?.id)
3. ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Fixing all remaining 21 endpoints
4. âœ… Created audit trail in database
5. âœ… Documented incident for compliance

## Technical Fix

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```javascript
const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id;
```

**After (Secure):**
```javascript
const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub;
if (!userId) {
  return res.status(401).json({ message: "User not properly authenticated" });
}
```

## Data Breach Scope

- **Affected Users:** test12@10xr.es (unauthorized access), hardmusicparty@gmail.com (data exposed)
- **Data Exposed:** User profile, food logs, weekly scores, subscription status
- **Access Method:** GDPR data export endpoint vulnerability

## Compliance Impact

- GDPR Article 33: Breach notification required within 72 hours
- User notification required due to high risk to individual rights
- Internal incident logging completed

## COMPLETED ACTIONS

1. âœ… Fixed data export endpoint (primary breach vector)
2. âœ… Applied security fix to all 22 vulnerable endpoints
3. âœ… Added strict authentication validation to prevent fallback
4. âœ… Created audit trail and incident documentation
5. âœ… Updated security incident database record
6. âœ… Created GDPR notification service for affected users

## TECHNICAL REMEDIATION

- Removed all `req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id` patterns
- Added mandatory authentication checks before data access
- Implemented security logging for data export attempts
- Enhanced error responses for unauthorized access

## Prevention

- Remove ALL fallback authentication patterns
- Implement strict user ID validation
- Add security audit logging for data access
- Regular security reviews of authentication code
