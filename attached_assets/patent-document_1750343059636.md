  verdict: Verdict;
  explanation: string;
  calories: number | null;
  protein: number | null;
  confidence: number;
  portion: string | null;
}

interface CachedAnalysis {

}
```

### 2. AI Analysis Pipeline

The AI analysis pipeline implements a multi-stage process:

1. **Image Processing**
   - Image capture and validation
   - Preprocessing for optimal AI analysis
   - Quality assessment and enhancement

2. **AI Analysis**
   - Google Gemini AI integration with specialized prompt:
   ```typescript
   const prompt = `You are YesOrNo, a brutally honest AI health assistant specializing in food analysis. Your task is to analyze food and provide a clear verdict.

   For the given food${imageBuffer ? ' image' : `: "${foodName}"`}, provide:
   1. A verdict: YES (healthy), NO (unhealthy), or OK (moderate)
   2. A brief, engaging explanation with personality
   3. Your best visual estimate of calories and protein content
   4. A confidence score
   5. A portion size estimate (e.g., "1 cup", "2 slices", "3 oz", "1 medium piece")

   Respond with JSON in this exact format:
   {
     "foodName": "The actual name of the food item",
     "verdict": "YES/NO/OK",
     "explanation": "Brief engaging explanation with personality",
     "calories": 250,
     "protein": 20,
     "confidence": 85,
     "portion": "1 cup"
   }

   IMPORTANT:
   - calories must be a whole number between 0 and 10000
   - protein must be a whole number between 0 and 2000
   - confidence must be a whole number between 80 and 99
   - portion should be a clear measurement (e.g., "1 cup", "2 slices", "3 oz")
   - Do not include any units or text in the numbers
   - Provide your best visual estimate of calories and protein based on what you can see
   - Consider portion sizes, ingredients, and typical nutritional values
   - If analyzing an image, pay close attention to portion sizes and ingredients
   - Be specific about the food item and provide accurate nutritional estimates
   - If analyzing an image, describe what you see in detail`;
   ```
   - Food recognition and classification
   - Nutritional content estimation

     return {
       foodItems: Array.isArray(analysis.foodItems) ? analysis.foodItems : [],
       nutritionFacts: analysis.nutritionFacts || {
         calories: 0,

         sugar: 0,
         sodium: 0,
         vitamins: {},
         minerals: {},
       },
       healthScore: Math.max(0, Math.min(100, analysis.healthScore || 50)),
       verdict: ['yes', 'ok', 'caution'].includes(analysis.verdict) 
         ? analysis.verdict 
         : 'ok',
       reasoning: analysis.reasoning || 'Analysis completed successfully.',
       alternatives: Array.isArray(analysis.alternatives) 
         ? analysis.alternatives.slice(0, 3) 
         : [],
       confidence: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, analysis.confidence || 0.8)),
     };
   }
   ```
   - No-food detection:
   ```typescript
   const noFoodData = analysis.explanation?.toLowerCase().includes('cannot identify any food') || 
                     analysis.explanation?.toLowerCase().includes('no food visible') ||
                     analysis.explanation?.toLowerCase().includes('not a food image') ||

       "Moderate choice. Not the worst, but not the best either. Watch your portions!",
       "This is okay in moderation. Consider healthier alternatives when possible."
     ],
     "N/A": [
       "I don't see any food to analyze. Please show me actual food!",
       "This doesn't look like food. Please take a picture of what you're eating.",
