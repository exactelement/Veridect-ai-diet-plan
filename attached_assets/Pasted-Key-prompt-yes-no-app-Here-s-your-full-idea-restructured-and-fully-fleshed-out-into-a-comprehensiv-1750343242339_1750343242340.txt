✅ YesOrNo – The Real-Time AI Health Assistant

A viral food & fitness decision-making system designed to improve lives—and disrupt an entire industry.

⸻

🧠 Core Concept

A real-time, AI-driven lifestyle assistant that guides users to make healthy decisions—meal by meal, bite by bite.
It gives instant “Yes” or “No” feedback on what to eat or skip, why that’s the recommendation, and how it fits into your personalized health goals.

Not just a food tracker.

This is a habit enforcer, a behavior corrector, and a gamified daily coach—combined with a scalable platform that merges AI, human expertise, and community.

⸻

🎯 Use Cases
	•	Skipping junk food in a weak moment? Ask the app.
	•	Unsure if that snack breaks your diet goal? Ask the app.
	•	Forgot to take your pills? The app checks in—and confirms visually if you did.
	•	Wondering how much you’ve eaten today? It tracks everything silently.
	•	Want accountability or punishment? It locks your screen until you do.
